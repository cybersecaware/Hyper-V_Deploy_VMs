# Deploy VM In Hyper-V
> James Maher | 10/06/22

--------------

## This is a basic PowerShell Script to deploy a virtual machine in Hyper-V

**_NOTE: The VHDX Path is hardcoded to 'E:\Hyper-V\Virtual Hard Disks\VMName\C_DRIVE.vhdx. E_DRIVE.vhdx is created in the same path if you choose a data drive._**

# To Do.

* Add error handling.
* Sanitise Input from user.
* Maybe ask user for the path to store their VHDX. Not required for now as this is where I will always store my VHDX files.
